Week 2 (21-01-2026) Folder: Week_02 Summary GAN Architecture: Implemented a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with customizable parameters. MNIST Dataset: Trained the GAN on the MNIST dataset with configurable epochs, batch size, and noise dimensions. Image Generation: Generated synthetic digit images using the trained generator network. LeNet-5 Classification: Evaluated the generated images using a LeNet-5 classifier to assess generation quality. Accuracy Evaluation: Calculated classifier accuracy on generated images and provided detailed prediction analysis.
